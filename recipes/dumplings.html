        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pork dumplings, also known as "jiaozi" or "potstickers," are a popular
            Chinese dish enjoyed worldwide. These bite-sized dumplings consist of a
            thin, doughy wrapper filled with a savory mixture of ground pork, vegetables,
            and seasonings. The filling is typically made by combining ground pork with
            ingredients like cabbage, scallions, garlic, ginger, soy sauce, and sesame oil,
            which contribute to its rich and flavorful taste.</p>
