        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Peking duck is a famous Chinese dish that originated in Beijing 
            (formerly known as Peking), hence its name. It is a roasted duck 
            dish that has been a significant part of Chinese cuisine for centuries. 
            Peking duck is renowned for its crispy skin and succulent meat, which 
            is often served with thin pancakes, scallions (green onions), cucumber 
            slices, and hoisin sauce.</p>

            <li>1 orange, sliced in rounds</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley, for garnish</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse duck inside and out; pat dry. Cut off tail and discard.</li>
            <li>Mix together cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, white pepper, and cloves in a 
                small bowl. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon spice mixture into cavity of duck. 
                Stir 1 tablespoon soy sauce into remaining spice mixture and rub 
                evenly over entire outside of duck. Cut 1 green onion in half and tuck 
                it inside cavity. Cover and refrigerate duck for at least 2 hours or 
                up to overnight.</li>
            <li>Place duck breast-side up on a rack set in a wok or pot. Steam for 1 
                hour, adding more water as it evaporates. Lift duck with two large 
                spoons to drain juices and green onion. Place duck breast-side up in 
                a roasting pan and prick skin all over with a fork.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Roast duck in the preheated oven for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Mix together remaining 2 tablespoons soy sauce and honey in a small 
                bowl. Brush honey mixture onto duck.</li>
            <li>Increase the oven temperature to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Roast 
                until skin is richly browned, about 5 minutes. Do not allow skin to 
                char.</li>
            <li>Mix together plum jam, chutney, sugar, and vinegar in a small serving 
                bowl. Chop remaining green onions and place them into a separate bowl.</li>
            <li>Place whole duck onto a serving platter and garnish with orange slices 
                and fresh parsley. Serve with plum sauce and chopped green onions.</li>
